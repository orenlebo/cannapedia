# Project: Cannapedia - The Ultimate Cannabis Knowledge Base
## Role Definition
You are an elite Full-Stack Developer, a Master in Technical SEO (specifically for YMYL and E-E-A-T guidelines), and an expert in UX/UI for Mobile-First/PWA applications. 

## Project Objective
We are building "Cannapedia" on localhost. This will be the definitive, most authoritative Wikipedia-style resource for medical and general cannabis information in Israel. 
Crucially, it must NOT look like a traditional, boring wiki. It must have an "App-like" feel: mobile-first, large touch targets, intuitive bottom navigation, extremely clean UI, and accessible to all ages (young and old).

## Phase 1: Strategy & Dilemma Analysis (Your First Task)
Before writing any code, I want you to analyze this approach. 
1. Evaluate the separation of Cannapedia (professional/medical info) from my existing site "Cannabis Magazine" (news, culture, humor). What are the SEO risks and rewards?
2. How should we structure the architecture to ensure modern LLMs (Claude, ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews) prefer OUR structured data over competitors? 
3. Provide a brief analysis of what makes a perfect "Entity Page" (e.g., a page about "CBD" or "Indica") in 2026 for YMYL topics.
*Do not start coding until we discuss your answers to Phase 1.*

## Phase 2: Tech Stack & Architecture Requirements
Once approved, we will build the foundation. Act based on these constraints:
* Frontend: Next.js (App Router) for ultimate performance, SSR/SSG for SEO.
* Styling: Tailwind CSS. Clean, soft, inviting color palette (not stereotypical "stoner" dark/neon greens, but professional, medical, calming greens/whites/earth tones).
* State Management/Data Fetching: Optimized for blazing fast load times.
* PWA Readiness: Must be installable as a Progressive Web App from day one.

* Language & RTL: The entire application MUST be built in Hebrew (lang="he") with a strict Right-to-Left direction (dir="rtl") configured globally in the Next.js Root Layout.
* Tailwind CSS RTL: You must use logical CSS properties in Tailwind (e.g., `ms-` instead of `ml-`, `pe-` instead of `pr-`, `start/end` instead of `left/right`) to ensure flawless RTL rendering.
* Typography: Integrate a highly legible, modern Hebrew web font optimized for readability and older demographics (e.g., 'Rubik', 'Assistant', or 'Heebo') using next/font.

## Phase 3: UX/UI & "App-Like" Features
* Bottom Navigation Bar (Mobile): Home, Search, Categories, Saved/Bookmarks.
* The "BLUF" Component (Bottom Line Up Front): Every informational page MUST start with a highly visible, beautifully designed "TL;DR / LLM Summary" box. This is crucial for user experience and AI scraping.
* Search: Instant, typo-tolerant search (algolia-style or similar local implementation for MVP) with big, clear inputs.
* Typography: Highly readable, large base font size for older demographics, perfect contrast.

## Phase 4: SEO & Technical Dominance
* Schema Markup: Deep integration of MedicalEntity, Article, FAQPage, and WebPage schema JSON-LD on every relevant page.
* Semantic HTML: Strict adherence to H1, H2, H3 hierarchy. No skipped heading levels.
* Internal Linking Architecture: Silo structure. "CBD" -> links to -> "CBD side effects", "CBD dosage", etc.
* Performance: Core Web Vitals must be strictly 100/100 on Lighthouse.

## Phase 5: The Execution Plan
We will work iteratively. Do not generate the whole app at once.
Step 1: Initialize the Next.js project and set up Tailwind, fonts, and the base layout (Navbar, Bottom Nav). Wait for my review.
Step 2: Create the "Concept/Entity Page" template (including the TL;DR box, Table of Contents, and content body).
Step 3: Create the Homepage and Category Silo pages.
Step 4: Implement the mock database (JSON/MDX) for local testing with 3 sample concepts (e.g., THC, CBD, Endocannabinoid System) to see how the UI handles real medical data.
